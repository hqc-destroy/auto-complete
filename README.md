# Visual Autocomplete For your Terminal
[Fig](https://withfig.com?ref=github_autocomplete) adds apps, shortcuts, and autocomplete to your Terminal. <br />

![Fig Visual Autocomplete For Your Terminal Demo](https://withfig.com/video/demos/autocomplete/autocomplete_demo_for_email.gif)

**Note**: We currently only work on iTerm2 and the native Terminal on macOS.

### Installation
1. Make sure you have Fig (version 1.0.20 or above) installed. We are currently in private beta. Sign up to our waitlist here: [https://withfig.com](https://withfig.com?ref=github_autocomplete)

2. Install the completion specs to your local device

```bash
$ fig update
```

3. In the Mac status bar (top right corner of the screen), click the Fig icon, and make sure *Autocomplete* is selected. If Autocomplete ever stops working, just toggle this button.

### Make Your Own Spec
Looking to improve autocomplete functionality, or to add support for your favorite CLI tool? We're welcoming contributions for new specs!
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more. 

Want to suggest a new spec? Open an issue at [withfig/fig](https://github.com/withfig/fig) and add the 'autocomplete' label.
