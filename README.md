## Add a completion spec for a CLI tool 
Looking to improve autocomplete functionality or add support for your favorite CLI tool? We welcome contributions for new specs!

Completion specs are defined in a *declarative* JSON schema, that specifies `subcommands`, `options` and `arguments`. Suggestions can be generated dynamically by running shell commands or reading local files, in addition to the information in the spec itself.

**For more documentation and tutorials**, visit [withfig.com/docs](https://withfig.com/docs/autocomplete/getting-started)

**To request completions for a CLI tool**, open an [issue](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete/issues/new).
