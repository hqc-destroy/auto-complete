## Add a completion spec for a CLI tool 
Looking to improve autocomplete functionality or add support for your favorite CLI tool? We welcome contributions for new specs!

Completion specs are defined in a *declarative* JSON schema, that specifies `subcommands`, `options` and `arguments`. Suggestions can be generated dynamically by running shell commands or reading local files, in addition to the information in the spec itself.

**For more documentation and tutorials**, visit [withfig.com/docs](https://withfig.com/docs/autocomplete/getting-started)

**To request completions for a CLI tool**, open an [issue](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete/issues/new).

=======

## Typechecking Your Spec
This Repository uses TypeScript to verify the types. 

You can typecheck the specs using 

```bash
npm test
```

## Using the specs locally
In order to use the the specs locally you first need to compile them.
You can do that by running

```bash
npm run build
```

after that you need to copy them into your local `.fig` folder.
You can do that by running
```bash
./copy.sh
```

### Linting Your Spec
The autocomplete spec linter can be run to validate the format of completion specs. Run it to get syntax and type errors from your autocomplete spec.

To use the linter, run the following command from the root folder.
`node linter.js specs/[specName].js`

To run the linter on ALL specs in the /specs folder, run
`node linter.js`
